# Algorithms-and-DS
This repository contains some selected pieces of the code I write in my free time to brush up Algo and DS and which I enjoy :). I'll keep adding more.

1. [LRU Cache](https://github.com/KapilJ22/Algorithms-and-DS/blob/master/LRU.py) ( Time complexity : O(1), space complexity : O(n) )
2. [Kth Largest Element in an Array](https://github.com/KapilJ22/Algorithms-and-DS/blob/master/Kth%20Largest%20Element%20in%20an%20Array.py) (Time complexity : O(n) average cases, O(n^2) worst case, Space complexity : O(1)
